    "# Topological Sort and Cycle Detection in Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)\n",
    "- **What it is**: A directed graph with no cycles (you can't follow arrows and end up back where you started)\n",
    "- **Example**: Course prerequisites, build dependencies, task scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example DAG:\n",
    "A → B → D\n",
    "↓   ↓\n",
    "C → E\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid topological orders: A,B,C,D,E or A,C,B,E,D or A,B,C,E,D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topological Sort\n",
    "- **Definition**: An ordering of vertices where for every edge from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering\n",
    "- **Key rule**: If there's an arrow from A → B, then A must appear before B in the sorted list\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world Example: Getting Dressed\n",
    "```\n",
    "Underwear → Pants → Belt → Jacket\n",
    "Socks → Shoes\n",
    "Shirt → Tie → Jacket\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid order: Underwear, Socks, Shirt, Pants, Shoes, Tie, Belt, Jacket\n",

    "## Finishing Order Method with Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Graph:\n",
    "```\n",
    "A → B → D\n",
    "↓   ↓\n",
    "C → E\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### DFS Traversal:\n",
    "1. **Start at A** (visit time: 1)\n",
    "2. **Go to B** (visit time: 2)\n",
    "3. **Go to D** (visit time: 3)\n",
    "4. **D has no outgoing edges** → **D finishes** (finish time: 4)\n",
    "5. **Back to B, go to E** (visit time: 5)\n",
    "6. **E has no outgoing edges** → **E finishes** (finish time: 6)\n",
    "7. **Back to B** → **B finishes** (finish time: 7)\n",
    "8. **Back to A, go to C** (visit time: 8)\n",
    "9. **C → E, but E already visited** → **C finishes** (finish time: 9)\n",
    "10. **Back to A** → **A finishes** (finish time: 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finishing Order: D(4), E(6), B(7), C(9), A(10)\n",
    "### Reverse Finishing Order: **A, C, B, E, D** ← This is our topological sort!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Reverse Finishing Order Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with edge A → C:\n",
    "- **Case 1**: A visited before C\n",
    "  - A will explore and finish C before A finishes\n",
    "  - Finishing order: ...C..., ...A...\n",
    "  - Reverse order: A comes before C ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case 2**: C visited before A (impossible with edge A → C in DAG)\n",
    "  - If C visited first, A cannot be reached from C (no cycles)\n",
    "  - So C finishes before A anyway\n",
    "  - Reverse order: A comes before C ✓\n",

    "Cycle: A → B → C → E → D → A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**DFS Process:**\n",
    "1. Start at A, visit B, visit C, visit E, visit D\n",
    "2. From D, try to visit A → **A is an ancestor!** → **Cycle detected!**\n",
