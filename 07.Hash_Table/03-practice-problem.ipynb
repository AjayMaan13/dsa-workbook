    "which supports the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **make_document()**: construct an empty document containing no images\n",
    "2. **import_image(x)**: add an image with unique integer ID x to the top of the document\n",

    "## Solution for Operations 1-3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structures:\n",
    "We use two data structures working together:\n",
    "1. **Doubly-linked list L**: Stores images in their actual order from bottom to top\n",
    "2. **Sorted array S**: Stores pairs of (image_id, pointer_to_node_in_L), sorted by image_id for fast lookups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations 1-3:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. make_document() - O(1)**\n",
    "- Initialize L as an empty doubly-linked list\n",
    "- Initialize S as an empty array\n",
    "- Both operations take constant time\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. import_image(x) - O(n)**\n",
    "- Create a new node containing image x\n",
    "- Add this node to the head of L (top of document) - O(1)\n",
    "- Insert the pair (x, pointer_to_new_node) into S in sorted order - O(n)\n",
    "  - This requires shifting existing elements to maintain sorted order\n",
    "- Total: O(n) due to the array insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. display() - O(n)**\n",
    "- Traverse L from tail to head (bottom to top)\n",
    "- Collect all image IDs into an array and return it\n",
    "- Must visit every node once: O(n)"

    "# The move_below(x, y) Operation - Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge\n",
    "We need to:\n",
    "1. Find image x anywhere in the document\n",
    "2. Find image y anywhere in the document  \n",
    "3. Remove x from its current position\n",
    "4. Place x directly below y\n",
    "5. Do all this in O(log n) time\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Fast Image Lookup - O(log n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Binary search in sorted array S for image x:\n",
    "S = [(1, ptr1), (3, ptr3), (7, ptr7), (12, ptr12), (15, ptr15)]\n",
    "Looking for image 7: binary search finds (7, ptr7) in O(log n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why sorted array?** If we just had the linked list, we'd need O(n) time to scan through and find image x. The sorted array gives us O(log n) lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Direct Access to Position - O(1)\n",
    "Once we find `(7, ptr7)` in the array, `ptr7` directly points to the exact node in our linked list L where image 7 currently sits.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "L: [img1] ↔ [img3] ↔ [img7] ↔ [img12] ↔ [img15]\n",
    "                      ↑\n",
    "                    ptr7 points here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**No scanning needed! We instantly know where image 7 is positioned.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Efficient Removal - O(1)\n",
    "With a **doubly-linked list**, removing a node when you have a direct pointer to it is O(1):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before: [img3] ↔ [img7] ↔ [img12]\n",
    "                  ↑\n",
    "                ptr7\n",
    "\n",
    "// Update pointers:\n",
    "img3.next = img12\n",
    "img12.prev = img3\n",
    "\n",
    "After: [img3] ↔ [img12]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why doubly-linked?** With single links, we'd need to find the previous node, which takes O(n). Double links let us update both directions instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Efficient Insertion - O(1)\n",
    "Similarly, we use binary search to find image y in O(log n), get its pointer, then insert x below it in O(1):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Find y: Binary search finds (12, ptr12)\n",
    "Insert x below y:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before: [img3] ↔ [img12] ↔ [img15]\n",
    "                  ↑\n",
    "                ptr12\n",
    "\n",
    "After:  [img3] ↔ [img12] ↔ [img7] ↔ [img15]\n",
    "                          ↑\n",
    "                    x inserted here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insight: Hybrid Data Structure Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sorted Array S provides:**\n",
    "- O(log n) lookup by image ID\n",
    "- Direct pointers to linked list nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Doubly-Linked List L provides:**\n",
    "- O(1) removal when you have the pointer\n",
    "- O(1) insertion when you know where to insert\n",
    "- Natural ordering of images from bottom to top\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Magic Moment\n",
    "The crucial realization is that **we never need to update the sorted array S** during move_below! We're only changing the order in the linked list L, but each image keeps the same ID and the same pointer relationship. The array S still correctly maps image IDs to their nodes - those nodes just have different neighbors now.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why move_below runs in O(log n) instead of O(n) - we avoid the expensive array reorganization."
