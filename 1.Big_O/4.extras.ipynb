    "## 1. Stirling's Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Stirling's approximation provides an excellent estimate for large factorials, which is extremely useful in combinatorics, probability theory, and statistical mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "$$n! \\sim \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The symbol `~` means \"asymptotically equivalent to\"\n",
    "- As $n$ becomes very large, this approximation becomes increasingly accurate\n",
    "- This is much easier to compute than calculating $n!$ directly for large values of $n$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** For $n = 10$:\n",
    "- Exact: $10! = 3,628,800$\n",
    "- Stirling's: $\\sqrt{20\\pi}(10/e)^{10} \\approx 3,598,696$\n",
    "- Error: Less than 1%\n",

    "## 2. Binomial Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** The binomial coefficient represents the number of ways to choose $k$ items from $n$ items without regard to order. Also known as \"n choose k\" or combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "$$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative notations:**\n",
    "- $C(n,k)$ or $C_n^k$\n",
    "- $_nC_k$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "- $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$ (symmetry)\n",
    "- $\\binom{n}{0} = \\binom{n}{n} = 1$\n",
    "- $\\binom{n}{1} = \\binom{n}{n-1} = n$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** How many ways to choose 2 items from 5?\n",
    "$$\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2! \\cdot 3!} = \\frac{120}{2 \\cdot 6} = 10$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Sequence Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** A mathematical sequence or tuple representing an ordered collection of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation:**\n",
    "$$(f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4, f_5)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- This represents a 5-tuple or sequence with elements $f_1$ through $f_5$\n",
    "- Each $f_i$ could represent:\n",
    "  - Function values: $f_i = f(i)$\n",
    "  - Frequency counts in statistics\n",
    "  - Coefficients in a polynomial\n",
    "  - Elements in a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common uses:**\n",
    "- **Statistics:** Frequency distribution $(f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4, f_5)$ where $f_i$ is the frequency of outcome $i$\n",
    "- **Probability:** Outcome probabilities that sum to 1\n",
    "- **Linear Algebra:** Vector components\n",
    "- **Computer Science:** Array or list elements\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection Between These Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "These formulas often appear together in **combinatorics and probability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stirling's approximation** helps compute large factorials efficiently\n",
    "2. **Binomial coefficients** use factorials to count combinations\n",
    "3. **Sequences** represent the data or outcomes we're analyzing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Application:** In a probability problem with 5 possible outcomes, we might:\n",
    "- Use the sequence $(f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4, f_5)$ to represent frequencies\n",
    "- Calculate combinations using $\\binom{n}{k}$\n",
    "- Approximate large factorials with Stirling's formula\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistics:** Multinomial distributions and hypothesis testing\n",
    "- **Computer Science:** Algorithm analysis and complexity theory\n",
    "- **Physics:** Statistical mechanics and thermodynamics\n",
    "- **Economics:** Decision theory and game theory"
