    "# Knight's Tour Code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knight's Tour is a classic chess-based puzzle where a knight must visit every square on a chessboard exactly once. The challenge lies in finding a sequence of valid knight moves that covers the entire board without repeating any square.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- A **chessboard** of size N×N (traditionally 8×8)\n",
    "- A **starting position** for the knight\n",
    "- **Knight movement rules**: L-shaped moves (2 squares in one direction, 1 square perpendicular)\n",
    "\n",
    "Find a **sequence of moves** such that:\n",
    "- The knight visits every square exactly once\n",
    "- All moves follow legal knight movement patterns\n",
    "- The tour may be **open** (ends anywhere) or **closed** (returns to start)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Knight Movement Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "A knight can move to 8 possible positions from any given square:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  2 1\n",
    "3   K   0\n",
    "4   K   7  \n",
    "  5 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From position (x,y), valid moves are:\n",
    "- (x+2, y+1), (x+1, y+2), (x-1, y+2), (x-2, y+1)\n",
    "- (x-2, y-1), (x-1, y-2), (x+1, y-2), (x+2, y-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Tours\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open Tour**: \n",
    "- Knight visits all squares exactly once\n",
    "- Ends at a different square than where it started\n",
    "- Easier to find than closed tours\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closed Tour**:\n",
    "- Knight visits all squares exactly once  \n",
    "- Returns to the starting square as the final move\n",
    "- Creates a complete cycle through all board positions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This is a Graph Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knight's Tour can be modeled as a **Hamiltonian Path** problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertices**: Each square on the chessboard represents a vertex\n",
    "- **Edges**: Connect squares that are one valid knight move apart\n",
    "- **Goal**: Find a Hamiltonian path (visits every vertex exactly once)\n",
    "- **Closed Tour**: Find a Hamiltonian cycle (path that returns to start)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Properties**:\n",
    "- **Unweighted**: All knight moves have equal cost\n",
    "- **Undirected**: If knight can move from A to B, it can move from B to A\n",
    "- **Regular Structure**: Interior squares have 8 connections, edge/corner squares have fewer\n",
    "- **Sparse**: Each vertex connects to at most 8 others\n",
    "\n",
    "**Board Analysis**:\n",
    "- **8×8 board**: 64 vertices, varying degrees (2-8 connections per square)\n",
    "- **Corner squares**: Only 2 possible moves\n",
    "- **Edge squares**: 3-6 possible moves  \n",
    "- **Interior squares**: Up to 8 possible moves\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Difficulty**:\n",
    "- **NP-Complete**: No known polynomial-time algorithm for general case\n",
    "- **Exponential Search Space**: Number of possible paths grows exponentially\n",
    "- **Backtracking Required**: Must explore and backtrack when paths fail\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Properties**:\n",
    "- **Solution Existence**: Proven that solutions exist for all N×N boards where N ≥ 5\n",
    "- **Multiple Solutions**: Many different valid tours exist for standard boards\n",
    "- **Symmetry**: Solutions can be rotated and reflected to create variations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Design**:\n",
    "- **Backtracking Techniques**: Classic example for recursive backtracking\n",
    "- **Heuristic Methods**: Testing optimization strategies and pruning techniques\n",
    "- **Parallel Computing**: Exploring parallel search algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Uses**:\n",
    "- **Path Planning**: Robot navigation with movement constraints\n",
    "- **Game Development**: AI movement patterns in games\n",
    "- **Educational Tool**: Teaching graph theory and algorithm design\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithmic Strategies**:\n",
    "1. **Brute Force Backtracking**: Try all possible paths systematically\n",
    "2. **Heuristic Approaches**: Use rules like Warnsdorff's heuristic (choose squares with fewest onward moves)\n",
    "3. **Divide and Conquer**: Split board into smaller sections\n",
    "4. **Mathematical Constructions**: Use number theory patterns for specific board sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Considerations**:\n",
    "- **Move Ordering**: Choosing which moves to try first affects performance\n",
    "- **Pruning**: Early detection of impossible paths\n",
    "- **Symmetry Breaking**: Avoiding redundant symmetric solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knight's Tour elegantly combines chess strategy, graph theory, and computational complexity, making it a perfect example for studying constrained path-finding algorithms."
