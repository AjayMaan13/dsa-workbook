    "## üåü What is Johnson's Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imagine you're a logistics company that needs to find the shortest routes between ALL pairs of cities in your delivery network.** Some routes have tolls (positive costs), some have government subsidies (negative costs), but you want to use the fastest GPS algorithm (Dijkstra) which only works with positive costs. Johnson's algorithm is like a clever accountant who \"adjusts the books\" to make all costs positive while keeping the relative route rankings exactly the same!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Definition:** Johnson's algorithm finds **shortest paths between ALL pairs of vertices** in a weighted graph (including negative weights) by cleverly transforming the graph to have non-negative weights, then using Dijkstra efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üè¢ Real-World Analogy: Corporate Restructuring\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Johnson's algorithm as a financial restructuring consultant:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You have a business network** with various costs and credits between departments\n",
    "2. **Some departments give rebates** (negative edge weights)\n",
    "3. **You want to use efficient accounting software** (Dijkstra) that only handles positive numbers\n",
    "4. **The consultant adjusts all the books** using a \"potential function\" to make everything positive\n",
    "5. **The relative costs stay the same** - cheapest routes remain cheapest!\n",

    "\n",

    "$$w'(u,v) = w(u,v) + h(u) - h(v)$$\n",
    "preserves shortest paths between all vertex pairs.\n",

    "**Theorem:** If Bellman-Ford finds Œ¥(s,v) = -‚àû for any vertex v, then the original graph contains a negative cycle.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå What NOT to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forgetting negative cycle check** - Algorithm assumes no negative cycles\n",
    "2. **Incorrect distance conversion** - Must subtract h(u) and add h(v)\n",
    "3. **Using with positive weights only** - Just use Dijkstra √ó V times\n",
    "4. **Applying to dense graphs** - Floyd-Warshall is simpler and often faster\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Johnson's Algorithm when:\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Need all-pairs shortest paths\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Graph has negative edge weights\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Graph is sparse (E ‚â™ V¬≤)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Want better than O(V¬≥) performance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Complexity:\n",
    "**Time:** O(V¬≤log V + VE) - optimal for sparse graphs with negative weights  \n",
    "**Space:** O(V¬≤) - stores complete distance matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom Line:** Johnson's algorithm is the perfect solution when you need all-pairs shortest paths in sparse graphs with negative weights - it's like having the best of both Bellman-Ford (handles negatives) and Dijkstra (fast execution)!"
