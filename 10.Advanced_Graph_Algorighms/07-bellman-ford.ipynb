    "**Problem:** Given undirected graph $G$, return whether $G$ contains a negative-weight cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Return \"Yes\" if there is ANY edge with negative weight in $G$ in $O(|E|)$ time.\n",

    "### Simple Shortest Paths (Critical Theorem)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claim 1:** If $\\delta(s,v)$ is finite, there exists a shortest path to $v$ that is simple (no repeated vertices).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof by Contradiction:**\n",
    "1. Suppose no simple shortest path exists\n",
    "2. Let $\\pi$ be a shortest path with the fewest vertices\n",
    "3. Since $\\pi$ is not simple, it contains some cycle $C$\n",
    "4. $C$ must have non-negative weight (otherwise $\\delta(s,v) = -\\infty$)\n",
    "5. Removing $C$ from $\\pi$ creates path $\\pi'$ with fewer vertices and $w(\\pi') \\leq w(\\pi)$\n",
    "6. This contradicts our assumption that $\\pi$ had the fewest vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Corollary:** Since simple paths cannot repeat vertices, finite shortest paths contain at most $|V| - 1$ edges.\n",

    "This invariant is why V-1 iterations suffice: since the longest simple path \n",
    "has V-1 edges, δ_{V-1}(s,v) equals the true shortest distance δ(s,v) when \n",
    "no negative cycles exist.\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Question 8: Prove Correctness\n",
    "**Q: \"Prove that Bellman-Ford correctly detects negative cycles.\"**\n",

    "**Proof Structure:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"By contradiction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suppose a negative cycle C exists but isn't detected\n",
    "2. After V-1 iterations, no edge can be relaxed\n",
    "3. But C has negative total weight, so repeatedly traversing C decreases distances\n",
    "4. This means some edge in C can still be relaxed\n",
    "5. Contradiction!\n",
