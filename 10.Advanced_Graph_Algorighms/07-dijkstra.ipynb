    "\n",
    "### Why Dijkstra?\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS fails on weighted graphs. In this example, BFS says shortest path from $s$ to $d$ is direct (1 edge), but actual shortest is $s \\rightarrow a \\rightarrow b \\rightarrow d$:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Mathematical Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-negative Weights Property\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** If all edge weights are non-negative, distances are **monotonic** along shortest paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Statement:** If vertex $u$ appears on shortest path from $s$ to $v$:\n",
    "$$\\delta(s, u) \\leq \\delta(s, v)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows processing vertices in order of increasing distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relaxation Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "For edge $(u, v)$ with weight $w(u, v)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{if } d(s, v) > d(s, u) + w(u, v) \\text{ then } d(s, v) := d(s, u) + w(u, v)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning:** \"Can I reach $v$ faster by going through $u$?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "1. **Process vertices in distance order** from source\n",
    "2. **Use priority queue** to efficiently find next closest vertex\n",
    "3. **Relax edges** to update distance estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structure: Changeable Priority Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** A priority queue $Q$ that supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Purpose | Time Complexity |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|-----------------|\n",

    "| `Q.delete_min()` | Remove and return item with minimum key | $O(\\log n)$ |\n",
    "| `Q.decrease_key(id, k)` | Update item with ID `id` to have key `k` | $O(\\log n)$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Details:**\n",
    "- **Cross-linking:** Combine Priority Queue $Q'$ with Dictionary $D$ mapping IDs to positions in $Q'$\n",
    "- **Vertex IDs:** Assume integers from $0$ to $|V| - 1$ for direct array access\n",
    "- **Item representation:** Each item is tuple $(v, d(s, v))$ where $v$ is vertex ID and $d(s, v)$ is distance estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operation Count\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra performs these operations on a priority queue with $n$ items:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Times Called | Individual Cost |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| `Q.build(X)` | $1$ | $B_n$ |\n",

    "| `Q.decrease_key()` | $|E|$ | $D_n$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Time:** $O(B_{|V|} + |V| \\cdot M_{|V|} + |E| \\cdot D_{|V|})$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:**\n",
    "1. Set $d(s, v) = \\infty$ for all $v \\in V$\n",
    "2. Set $d(s, s) = 0$ \n",
    "3. Build priority queue $Q$ with items $(v, d(s, v))$ for each vertex $v$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Loop:**\n",
    "4. While $Q$ is not empty:\n",
    "   a. Delete item $(u, d(s, u))$ with minimum $d(s, u)$ from $Q$\n",
    "   b. For each vertex $v$ in outgoing adjacencies $\\text{Adj}^+(u)$:\n",
    "      i. If $d(s, v) > d(s, u) + w(u, v)$:\n",
    "         - Relax: set $d(s, v) = d(s, u) + w(u, v)$  \n",
    "         - Decrease key of $v$ in $Q$ to new $d(s, v)$\n",

    "**Theorem:** At algorithm end, $d(s, v) = \\delta(s, v)$ for all $v \\in V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof by induction** on vertices removed from queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base:** First vertex removed is $s$ with $d(s, s) = 0 = \\delta(s, s)$ ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inductive Step:** For $k_0$-th vertex $v_0$ removed, consider shortest path $\\pi$ from $s$ to $v_0$. Let $(x, y)$ be first edge where $y$ wasn't among first $k_0-1$ vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $x$ was removed: $d(s, y) \\leq \\delta(s, x) + w(x, y) = \\delta(s, y) \\leq \\delta(s, v_0) \\leq d(s, v_0) \\leq d(s, y)$\n",

    "### ❌ Red Flags to Avoid:\n",
    "1. **Forgetting the visited set** → May process vertices multiple times\n",
    "2. **Using with negative weights** → Will give wrong answers\n",
    "3. **Not handling disconnected graphs** → Some nodes stay at infinity\n",
    "4. **Wrong priority queue usage** → Using max-heap instead of min-heap\n",
    "5. **Inefficient graph representation** → Using adjacency matrix for sparse graphs\n",

    "### ✅ Green Flags to Hit:\n",
    "1. **Mention non-negative weight requirement** upfront\n",
    "2. **Explain the greedy choice property**\n",
    "3. **Handle edge cases** (empty graph, single node, unreachable nodes)\n",
    "4. **Optimize when possible** (early termination for single target)\n",
    "5. **Analyze time/space complexity** correctly\n",
