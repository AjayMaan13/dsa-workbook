    "# Dijkstra's Algorithm: Complete Beginner-to-Expert Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌟 What is Dijkstra's Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imagine you're using Google Maps to find the fastest route home.** Your phone needs to calculate the shortest path from your current location to your house, considering traffic (weights on roads). That's exactly what Dijkstra's algorithm does!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Definition:** Dijkstra's algorithm finds the **shortest path** from one starting point to all other points in a weighted graph, like finding the fastest route from your location to every possible destination in your city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚗 Real-World Analogy: GPS Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Dijkstra as a super-smart GPS system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You're at point A** (source vertex)\n",
    "2. **Roads have different speeds/distances** (weighted edges)  \n",
    "3. **You want the fastest route to every location** (shortest path to all vertices)\n",
    "4. **The algorithm explores closer locations first** (greedy approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: You're at Home (H) and want to reach Work (W)\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct route: H ——————50 minutes——————→ W\n",
    "But there's a faster route: H →(10min)→ Subway →(15min)→ W = 25 minutes total!\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra finds this optimal 25-minute route.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Why Do We Need Dijkstra?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Simple Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**BFS (Breadth-First Search)** works great for unweighted graphs but fails when edges have different weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "s ——————100—————— → d\n",
    "|                   ↑\n",
    "1                   1\n",
    "↓                   |\n",
    "a ————1——— → b  ————↑\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BFS says:** Shortest path from `s` to `d` is direct (1 edge)\n",
    "- **Reality:** Path `s → a → b → d` is much shorter (3 minutes vs 100 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is why we need Dijkstra!** It considers edge weights, not just the number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 How Does Dijkstra Work? (Simple Explanation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Always go to the closest unvisited place first, then update your knowledge about how to reach other places.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start** at source with distance 0, mark others as ∞\n",
    "2. **Always pick** closest unvisited vertex (Here closest mean, its neighbor)\n",
    "3. **For each neighbor ,** \"Can I reach it faster through current vertex?\" (means, choose edge-to-vertex with least weight among the knows neighbors)\n",
    "4. **If yes,**  update distance and priority queue\n",
    "5. **Repeat** until you've visited all locations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎮 Interactive Example: Finding Route in a City\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you're at **Station S** and want to find shortest routes to all locations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Initial distances from S:\n",
    "- S to S: 0 minutes\n",
    "- S to A: ∞ (unknown)\n",
    "- S to B: ∞ (unknown)  \n",
    "- S to C: ∞ (unknown)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** From S, you can directly reach A (10 min) and C (5 min)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Updated distances:\n",
    "- S to A: 10 minutes\n",
    "- S to C: 5 minutes (closest unvisited!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Visit C (closest), from C you can reach B (3 min)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Path S→C→B = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes\n",
    "Updated: S to B: 8 minutes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Continue until all locations are visited...\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Algorithm Family Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand what Dijkstra does, let's see where it fits in the family of shortest path algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Graph Type | Weight Restrictions | Algorithm | Time Complexity | Use Case |\n",
    "|------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|\n",
    "| General | Unweighted | BFS | $O(\\|V\\| + \\|E\\|)$ | Social networks (degrees of separation) |\n",
    "| DAG | Any weights | DAG Relaxation | $O(\\|V\\| + \\|E\\|)$ | Project scheduling |\n",
    "| General | **Non-negative** | **Dijkstra** | $O(\\|V\\| \\log \\|V\\| + \\|E\\|)$ | **GPS, Network routing** |\n",
    "| General | Any weights | Bellman-Ford | $O(\\|V\\| \\cdot \\|E\\|)$ | Currency exchange, detecting negative cycles |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point:** Dijkstra is optimal for weighted graphs with **non-negative edge weights** (like real-world distances, travel times, or costs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 Core Mathematical Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-negative Weights Property\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** If all edge weights are non-negative, distances are **monotonic** along shortest paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Statement:** If vertex $u$ appears on shortest path from $s$ to $v$:\n",
    "$$\\delta(s, u) \\leq \\delta(s, v)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means in plain English:** \"If you're on the shortest path from S to your destination, the distance to any point along the way is less than or equal to the distance to your final destination.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This property allows processing vertices in order of increasing distance - the **greedy approach** works!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relaxation Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Question:** \"Can I reach vertex $v$ faster by going through vertex $u$?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For edge $(u, v)$ with weight $w(u, v)$:\n",
    "$$\\text{if } d(s, v) > d(s, u) + w(u, v) \\text{ then } d(s, v) := d(s, u) + w(u, v)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world meaning:** \n",
    "- Current best time to reach $v$: 20 minutes\n",
    "- Time to reach $u$: 8 minutes  \n",
    "- Time from $u$ to $v$: 5 minutes\n",
    "- New path through $u$: 8 + 5 = 13 minutes\n",
    "- Since 13 < 20, update the best time to 13 minutes!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ The Algorithm in Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "1. **Process vertices in distance order** from source (closest first)\n",
    "2. **Use priority queue** to efficiently find next closest vertex\n",
    "3. **Relax edges** to update distance estimates when better paths are found\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structure: Changeable Priority Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** A priority queue $Q$ that supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Purpose | Time Complexity | Real-world analogy |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| `Q.build(X)` | Initialize $Q$ with items from iterator $X$ | $O(n)$ | Set up your route planning system |\n",
    "| `Q.delete_min()` | Remove and return item with minimum key | $O(\\log n)$ | Pick the closest unvisited location |\n",
    "| `Q.decrease_key(id, k)` | Update item with ID `id` to have key `k` | $O(\\log n)$ | Update travel time when you find a faster route |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Details:**\n",
    "- **Cross-linking:** Combine Priority Queue $Q'$ with Dictionary $D$ mapping IDs to positions in $Q'$\n",
    "- **Vertex IDs:** Assume integers from $0$ to $|V| - 1$ for direct array access\n",
    "- **Item representation:** Each item is tuple $(v, d(s, v))$ where $v$ is vertex ID and $d(s, v)$ is distance estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operation Count\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra performs these operations on a priority queue with $n$ items:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Times Called | Individual Cost | What it does |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|\n",
    "| `Q.build(X)` | $1$ | $B_n$ | Initial setup |\n",

    "| `Q.decrease_key()` | $|E|$ | $D_n$ | Update distances when better path found |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Time:** $O(B_{|V|} + |V| \\cdot M_{|V|} + |E| \\cdot D_{|V|})$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:**\n",
    "1. Set $d(s, v) = \\infty$ for all $v \\in V$ (\"I don't know how to reach any location yet\")\n",
    "2. Set $d(s, s) = 0$ (\"I'm already at the starting point\")\n",
    "3. Build priority queue $Q$ with items $(v, d(s, v))$ for each vertex $v$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Loop:**\n",
    "4. While $Q$ is not empty:\n",
    "   a. Delete item $(u, d(s, u))$ with minimum $d(s, u)$ from $Q$ (\"Visit the closest unvisited location\")\n",
    "   b. For each vertex $v$ in outgoing adjacencies $\\text{Adj}^+(u)$: (\"Check all neighbors of current location\")\n",
    "      i. If $d(s, v) > d(s, u) + w(u, v)$: (\"Can I get there faster through this route?\")\n",
    "         - Relax: set $d(s, v) = d(s, u) + w(u, v)$ (\"Update with the faster route\")\n",
    "         - Decrease key of $v$ in $Q$ to new $d(s, v)$ (\"Update the priority queue\")\n",

    "## ✅ Correctness Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem:** At algorithm end, $d(s, v) = \\delta(s, v)$ for all $v \\in V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simple terms:** \"When Dijkstra finishes, the distances it computed are guaranteed to be the true shortest distances.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof by induction** on vertices removed from queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base:** First vertex removed is $s$ with $d(s, s) = 0 = \\delta(s, s)$ ✓ (\"We start at distance 0 from ourselves\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inductive Step:** For $k_0$-th vertex $v_0$ removed, consider shortest path $\\pi$ from $s$ to $v_0$. Let $(x, y)$ be first edge where $y$ wasn't among first $k_0-1$ vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $x$ was removed: $d(s, y) \\leq \\delta(s, x) + w(x, y) = \\delta(s, y) \\leq \\delta(s, v_0) \\leq d(s, v_0) \\leq d(s, y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "All inequalities are equalities, so $d(s, v_0) = \\delta(s, v_0)$ ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** This proof guarantees that Dijkstra always finds the correct shortest paths, not just approximate ones.\n",

    "|---------------|-------|------------|--------------|------------|----------|\n",
    "| Array | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ | $O(\\|V\\|^2)$ | Dense graphs (many edges) |\n",
    "| Binary Heap | $O(n)$ | $O(\\log n)$ | $O(\\log n)$ | $O(\\|E\\| \\log \\|V\\|)$ | Sparse graphs (few edges) |\n",

    "### Practical Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Dense Graphs:** $|E| = \\Theta(|V|^2)$ → Use Array implementation → $O(|V|^2)$ time\n",
    "- Example: Social networks where everyone knows everyone\n",

    "**For Sparse Graphs:** $|E| = \\Theta(|V|)$ → Use Binary Heap → $O(|V| \\log |V|)$ time  \n",
    "- Example: Road networks (each intersection connects to only a few others)\n",

    "### ❌ What NOT to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using with negative weights** - Dijkstra gives wrong answers!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Example: Edge with weight -10 can make longer paths shorter\n",
    "   Dijkstra assumes once we visit a vertex, we've found the shortest path to it\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forgetting visited check** - May process vertices multiple times\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Wrong: might process same vertex multiple times\n",
    "   current_dist, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n",

    "   \n",
    "   # Right: check if already visited\n",
    "   if u in visited:\n",
    "       continue\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using wrong data structure for graph density**\n",
    "   - Dense graph with array → Good\n",
    "   - Sparse graph with array → Wasteful\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always verify non-negative weights** before using Dijkstra\n",
    "2. **Choose right data structure** based on graph density  \n",
    "3. **Handle edge cases** (empty graph, unreachable vertices)\n",

    "- ✅ Want optimal performance for this specific case\n",
    "- ✅ Real-world routing/pathfinding problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Don't use Dijkstra when:\n",

    "### Question 1: \"Explain Dijkstra's algorithm\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perfect Answer Structure:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Dijkstra's algorithm finds shortest paths from a source vertex to all other \n",
    "vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key insight: We can process vertices in order of increasing distance from \n",
    "source because of the non-negative weight property - distances are monotonic \n",
    "along shortest paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses a priority queue to efficiently find the next closest \n",
    "unprocessed vertex, then relaxes all edges from that vertex to update \n",
    "distance estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity is O(E + V log V) with a binary heap implementation.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Follow-up:** \"Why does it fail with negative weights?\"\n",

    "## 🔥 Advanced Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: \"Analyze time complexity for different implementations\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Framework Answer:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Time complexity depends on the priority queue implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary Heap: O(E log V)\n",
    "   - Each of E edges might trigger decrease-key operation: O(log V)\n",
    "   - Each of V vertices extracted once: O(V log V)\n",
    "   - Total: O((E + V) log V) = O(E log V) for connected graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Array (for dense graphs): O(V²)\n",
    "   - Extract min: O(V) done V times = O(V²)\n",
    "   - Decrease key: O(1) done E times = O(E)\n",
    "   - Better when E = Θ(V²)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fibonacci Heap (theoretical): O(E + V log V)\n",
    "   - Amortized decrease-key: O(1)\n",
    "   - But complex implementation, rarely used in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "For interviews, assume O(E log V) with binary heap.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### Question 5: \"When would you NOT use Dijkstra?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perfect Answer:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Don't use Dijkstra when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Negative edge weights exist → Use Bellman-Ford\n",
    "2. Unweighted graph → Use BFS (simpler and faster)\n",
    "3. Need to detect negative cycles → Use Bellman-Ford\n",
    "4. Graph is a DAG → Use topological sort + relaxation (O(V + E))\n",
    "5. Memory is extremely limited → Consider A* with good heuristic\n",
    "\n",
    "Key insight: Dijkstra assumes non-negative weights for its greedy approach to work.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6: \"How would you modify Dijkstra for these scenarios?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario A: \"Find K shortest paths\"**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def k_shortest_paths(graph, start, end, k):\n",
    "    # Use modified Dijkstra where each node can be visited k times\n",
