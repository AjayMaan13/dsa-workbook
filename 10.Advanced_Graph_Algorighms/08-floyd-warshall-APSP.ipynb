    "\n",
    "**Floyd-Warshall** finds the **shortest paths between ALL pairs of vertices** or **APSP - All Pair Shortest Path** in a weighted graph. Unlike Dijkstra (**single source, or SSSP->Single Source Shortest Path**) or Bellman-Ford, this algorithm computes distances from every vertex to every other vertex in one go.\n",

    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- ✅ Works with **negative edge weights**\n",
    "- ✅ Detects **negative cycles**\n",
    "- ✅ Simple **O(V³)** implementation\n",
    "- ❌ Not suitable for sparse graphs\n",

    "Floyd-Warshall is essentially dynamic programming:\n",
    "- **Subproblem:** Shortest path from i to j using vertices {1,2,...,k}\n",
    "- **Recurrence:** `dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i][j][k-1], dp[i][k][k-1] + dp[k][j][k-1])`\n",
    "- **Space optimization:** We only need current iteration, so 2D array suffices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "- **Network routing:** Find optimal paths in computer networks\n",
    "- **Transportation:** Plan routes in road/flight networks  \n",
    "- **Game AI:** Pathfinding in game worlds\n",
    "- **Social networks:** Find connection paths between people\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Interpretation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# dist[i][j] = shortest distance from vertex i to vertex j\n",
    "# If dist[i][j] = ∞, no path exists from i to j\n",
    "# If dist[i][i] < 0, negative cycle detected\n",
    "```\n",
