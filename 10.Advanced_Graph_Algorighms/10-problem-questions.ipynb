    "An image is a 2D grid of black and white square pixels where each white pixel is contained in a blob. Two white pixels are in the same blob if they share an edge of the grid. Black pixels are not contained in blobs. Given an n × m array representing an image, describe an O(nm)-time algorithm to count the number of blobs in the image.\n"

    "## Solution Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Official Instructor Solution\n",
    "**Construct a graph G with a vertex per white pixel, with an undirected edge between two vertices if the pixels associated with them are both white and share an edge of the grid. This graph has size at most O(nm) vertices and at most O(nm) edges (as pixels share edges with at most four other pixels), so can be constructed in O(nm) time. Each connected component of this graph corresponds to a blob, so run Full-BFS or Full-DFS to count the number of connected components in G in O(nm) time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Problem\n",
    "This is fundamentally a **connected components** problem. We need to:\n",
    "1. Identify groups of white pixels that are connected to each other\n",
    "2. Count how many separate groups (blobs) exist\n",
    "3. Two pixels are connected if they share an edge (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Construction (Following Instructor's Approach)\n",
    "We explicitly construct graph G = (V, E) where:\n",
    "- **Vertices (V)**: One vertex for each white pixel in the grid\n",
    "- **Edges (E)**: Undirected edge between two vertices if their corresponding pixels are both white and share an edge of the grid\n",
    "- **Key insight**: Each connected component in G corresponds exactly to one blob\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Size Analysis\n",
    "- **Vertices**: At most nm vertices (if all pixels are white)\n",
    "- **Edges**: At most O(nm) edges because each pixel shares edges with at most 4 other pixels\n",
    "- **Construction time**: O(nm) to scan grid and build graph\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Strategy: Connected Components\n",
    "1. **Graph construction**: Build graph G as described above\n",
    "2. **Connected components**: Run Full-BFS or Full-DFS to count connected components\n",
    "3. **Result**: Number of connected components = number of blobs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "- **Correctness**: Each blob is exactly one connected component of white pixels\n",
    "- **Completeness**: We examine every white pixel, so no blobs are missed\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Graph traversal visits each vertex and edge exactly once\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "- **Graph construction**: O(nm) time to scan grid and create vertices/edges\n",
    "- **Connected components**: O(|V| + |E|) = O(nm + nm) = O(nm) using Full-BFS/DFS\n",
    "- **Overall time complexity**: O(nm) ✓\n",

    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Graph Structure with Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: What Does |E| = |V| Mean?\n",

    "### Key Insight: Exactly One Cycle\n",
    "- A tree with 5 vertices has 4 edges\n",
    "- Our graph has 5 vertices and 5 edges  \n",

    "Think of it like finding the best route in a city with exactly one \"loop road\":\n",

    "### Step 1: Find the Loop Road\n",
    "- Walk around the city systematically\n",
    "- When you find a road that creates a loop (you've been to one end before), that's your cycle edge\n",
    "- In our example: when we discover edge CE, we realize C and E are already connected through B→D\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Try Both Routes\n",
    "**Route 1**: Ignore the loop road entirely\n",
    "- Find the path from A to E using only the \"main roads\" (tree edges)\n",
    "- A → B → D → E with total weight = weight(AB) + weight(BD) + weight(DE)\n",

    "1. **Step 1 (Layered Graph)**:\n",
    "   - Graph G₁ size: O(|V|²) vertices, O(|V|²|E|) edges  \n",
    "   - Since |E| ≤ |V|², we have O(|V|⁴) edges\n",
    "   - DAG relaxation: O(vertices + edges) = O(|V|⁴)\n",
    "   - **Wait, this seems wrong...**\n",

    "**Correction from Instructor Solution**:\n",
    "- G₁ has O(|V|²) vertices and O(|V||E|) edges\n",
    "- DAG relaxation: O(|V|² + |V||E|) = O(|V|³) since |E| ≤ |V|²\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step 2 (Reversed Graph)**:\n",

    "4. **Total**: O(|V|³) ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decomposition**: Split long paths into \"exactly |V| edges\" + \"any remaining edges\"\n",
    "2. **Layered Graph**: Track edge count by creating vertex copies for each layer\n",
    "3. **Graph Reversal**: Convert \"paths TO target\" into \"paths FROM target\"  \n",
    "4. **DAG Property**: Layered graph is naturally acyclic, enabling efficient SSSP\n",
    "5. **Bellman-Ford**: Handles arbitrary weights (including negative) in the original graph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem**: Find shortest path with at least |V| edges (unusual constraint!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution**: \n",
    "1. Use layered graph to find paths with exactly |V| edges\n",
    "2. Use reversed graph to find remaining path to target\n",
    "3. Combine optimally over all possible intermediate vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Works**: Every long path can be decomposed into \"first |V| edges\" + \"remaining path\", and we solve each subproblem optimally."
