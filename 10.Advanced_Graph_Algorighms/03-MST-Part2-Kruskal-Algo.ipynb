    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Global Sorting 📊\n",
    "```python\n",
    "edges = [(C,D,1), (F,G,2), (A,B,3), (D,E,4), (A,C,5), (B,E,6), (E,F,7), (B,G,8)]\n",

    "**Why sort?** We want to consider cheaper options first—this guarantees optimality!\n",

    "# Initially: each vertex is its own separate component\n",
    "{A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}, {F}, {G}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Think**: Every town starts as its own isolated kingdom.\n",

    "#### Step 3: Smart Edge Selection 🤝\n",

    "for edge in sorted_edges:\n",
    "    if connects_different_components(edge):\n",
    "        add_to_mst(edge)\n",

    "**Greedy Choice Principle**: At each step, we make the locally optimal choice (cheapest available edge) that's globally safe (connects different components).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safe Edge Theorem in Action**: Every edge we add is guaranteed to be safe because it connects different connected components with minimum weight among such edges.\n",

    "### 🚀 Disjoint Set Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Idea**: Maintain \"representatives\" for each connected component.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Operations:\n",
    "```python\n",
