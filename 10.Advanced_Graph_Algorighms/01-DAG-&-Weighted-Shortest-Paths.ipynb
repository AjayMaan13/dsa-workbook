    "Imagine you're planning a road trip. Not every road segment is the same:\n",
    "- Highway: 100 miles, 1.5 hours\n",
    "- City streets: 5 miles, 30 minutes  \n",
    "- Mountain pass: 20 miles, 2 hours\n",

    "\n",
    "You're at home (H) and want to visit three places:\n",
    "- Coffee shop (C): 2 minutes away\n",
    "- Friend's house (F): 15 minutes  \n",
    "- Grocery store (G): 8 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are shortcuts! F to G is only 3 minutes. Now finding the shortest path becomes interesting...\n",

    "**Option 1 - Embedded Style:**\n",

    "# Adjacency list with weights\n",
    "graph = {\n",
    "    'H': [('C', 2), ('F', 15), ('G', 8)],\n",
    "    'C': [('F', 10)],\n",
    "    'F': [('G', 3)],\n",
    "    'G': []\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2 - Separate Weight Map:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Graph structure + separate weights\n",
    "edges = [('H','C'), ('H','F'), ('H','G'), ('C','F'), ('F','G')]\n",
    "weights = {('H','C'): 2, ('H','F'): 15, ('H','G'): 8, ('C','F'): 10, ('F','G'): 3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Requirement**: We need $O(1)$ weight lookups (no searching through lists!)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 💰 Path Weight = Your Total Bill\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take a path $\\pi$ through a weighted graph, your **total cost** is:\n",
    "$$w(\\pi) = \\sum_{\\text{edges in } \\pi} w(\\text{edge})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Example**: Route H → C → F → G costs: 2 + 10 + 3 = 15 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Shortest Path Weight\n",
    "\n",
    "The **shortest path weight** from vertex $s$ to vertex $t$ is:\n",
    "$\\delta(s,t) = \\inf\\{w(\\pi) \\mid \\text{path } \\pi \\text{ from } s \\text{ to } t\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**🤔 Why \"infimum\" instead of \"minimum\"?** Sometimes no finite-length minimum-weight path exists! This happens when negative cycles are involved.\n",

    "- NYC → Chicago must be the best route to Chicago\n",
    "- Chicago → LA must be the best route from Chicago to LA\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why?* If either piece wasn't optimal, you could swap it for something better!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚫 When There's No Path\n",
    "$\\delta(s,t) = \\infty$ (You literally can't get there from here)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 😱 The Dark Side: Negative Cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where things get spicy! 🌶️\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's a Negative Cycle?\n",
    "A loop where going around actually **saves** you money/time/cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "**💸 Real Example**: Currency arbitrage\n",
    "- USD → EUR: lose 2%\n",
    "- EUR → GBP: lose 1%  \n",
    "- GBP → USD: gain 5%\n",
    "- Net effect: +2% (free money glitch!)\n",

    "- **Current estimate** $d(s, v)$: \"Best route I know so far to v\"\n",
    "- **Discovery**: \"Wait, going through u is cheaper!\"\n",
    "- **Update**: $d(s, v) = d(s, u) + w(u, v)$\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Rule**: Process vertex u before any vertex u can reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it works**: When we process vertex v, we've already found optimal paths to ALL vertices that can reach v. So we can safely finalize v's distance.\n",

    "## ✅ Why It Actually Works (Correctness Proof) {#correctness}\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 The Main Claim\n",
    "\n",
    "**Big Promise**: After DAG Relaxation finishes, $d(s, v) = \\delta(s, v)$ for every vertex $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation: *\"We find the TRUE shortest distance to every vertex.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Proof Strategy: Mathematical Induction\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this like proving dominoes fall: if the first few work, and each success causes the next success, then they all work!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🏁 Base Case\n",
    "The source vertex $s$ starts with $d(s, s) = 0 = \\delta(s, s)$. ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "Any unreachable vertices stay at $\\infty$, which is correct. ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔄 Inductive Step\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assume**: First $k$ vertices in topological order have correct distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prove**: The $(k+1)$-th vertex $v$ gets the correct distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Key Insight**: Consider the TRUE shortest path to $v$:\n",
    "```\n",
    "s → ... → u → v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's a DAG, vertex $u$ comes before $v$ in topological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logic Chain**:\n",
    "1. By induction: $d(s, u) = \\delta(s, u)$ ✅\n",
    "2. When processing $u$: we relax edge $(u, v)$\n",
    "3. This sets: $d(s, v) \\leq \\delta(s, u) + w(u, v) = \\delta(s, v)$\n",
    "4. But relaxation safety ensures: $d(s, v) \\geq \\delta(s, v)$\n",
    "5. Therefore: $d(s, v) = \\delta(s, v)$ ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎪 Alternative Proof (The Elegant Version)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Direct reasoning**: For any vertex $v$, DAG relaxation effectively computes:\n",
    "$d(s, v) = \\min\\{d(s, u) + w(u, v) \\mid u \\in \\text{Adj}^-(v)\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\text{Adj}^-(v)$ means all vertices that have edges pointing TO $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧠 Why this works**:\n",
    "- Every shortest path to $v$ must pass through some incoming neighbor $u$ of $v$\n",
    "- By induction: $d(s, u) = \\delta(s, u)$ for all such neighbors $u$  \n",
    "- Therefore: $d(s, v) = \\delta(s, v)$ ✅\n",
