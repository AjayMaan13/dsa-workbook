    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "X has heard complaints regarding the speed of their WiFi network. The network consists of r routers, some of which are marked as entry points which are connected to the rest of the internet. Some pairs of routers are directly connected to each other via bidirectional wires. Each wire wi between two routers has a known length ℓi measured in a positive integer number of feet. \n",
    "\n",
    "The latency of a router in the network is proportional to the minimum feet of wire a signal from the router must pass through to reach an entry point. Assume the latency of every router is finite and there is at most 100r feet of wire in the entire network.\n",

    "### Efficiency\n",
    "- The key insight is that even though we add intermediate nodes, the total graph size remains O(r) due to the constraint that total wire length ≤ 100r\n",
    "- This allows us to use the linear-time BFS algorithm instead of more expensive shortest-path algorithms like Dijkstra's\n",
